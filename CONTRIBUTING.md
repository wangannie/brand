## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to this project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE), and its [README](README.md).

## How to contribute

### Issues

If there’s anything you’d like to understand about STRIDES's visual design, brand, or assets, submit an issue about it. If you see something that should be fixed but don’t want to do so yourself, submit an issue. If you have an idea for an improvement... well, you get the idea.

### What to include in an issue

Not all of these will apply to all issues. But when they do, it’s very helpful to see them.

- **Description:** okay, this one does apply to all issues. :) 
- **How to reproduce:** if your issue is a bug, any information about how we can see it ourselves
- **Screenshots:** similarly, so we can see what you’re seeing
- **Files:** anything with helpful information about the issue
- **To dos:** if your issue is an enhancement, a list of improvements or steps to help us meet the goal of the enhancement

If your issue is a request for a new template or asset, tell us about what you need, and how it would be useful to you.

### Where to submit a pull request

Submit pull requests to the `master` branch. This is the main branch. If you’re not sure how to submit a pull request, feel free to submit an issue and we will try to address it ourselves.

### What to include in a pull request

Including these will help us be faster and better at responding.

- **Changes:** a list, preferably bulleted, of what you’re changing
- **Notes:** anything that might help us understand the change, like why you’re doing it or alternative approaches you tried
- **Screenshots:** if your pull request will affect layout or interaction, to show us what you’re fixing or changing
