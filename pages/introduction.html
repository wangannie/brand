title: Introduction
---

<p>This toolkit was developed for NIH employees, but we hope it&rsquo;s a useful reference for anyone.</p>

<p>Our visual identity is a flexible system that helps you communicate clearly while building visual consistency across our work. It features a growing set of templates and guides you can use to meet common design needs â€” and save time in the process.</p>

<p>This identity is integral to our ability to communicate our goals and deliver high-quality products. We recognize that having a strong brand is as important for government agencies as it is for private companies, and our users expect nothing less.</p>

<p>Because a brand communicates our core values, it helps us build trust with our partners, increase engagement, foster input and open-source contributions, and improve the public&rsquo;s perception of government, all of which are central to our mission.</p>

<h2>Feedback or questions</h2>
<p>This is not a complete brand style guide, and it&rsquo;s still an early draft. We&rsquo;ll continue adding to this as we can, but there is no dedicated team at the moment.</p>

<p>We welcome your feedback and contributions so that we can continue to chip away at the highest priority needs for the STRIDES Initiative team. If you have any suggestions or are interested in getting involved, <a href="https://github.com/NIHGOV/STRIDES-Brand/issues/new">create an issue in GitHub</a>.</p>
