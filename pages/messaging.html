<p>Source: <a href="https://nih.app.box.com/file/654096025968">STRIDES Initiative Style Guide on Box</a></p>
<p>In general, STRIDES Initiative materials follow the
    <a href="https://intranet.cit.nih.gov/admin/oco/Public%20Documents/Tools%20and%20Templates/Guides/CIT%20Style%20Guide.pdf">CIT style guide</a>. CIT uses AP style with some CIT specifications. For detailed CIT style guidance, reference the resources below.</p>
<p>This document outlines the STRIDES Initiative grammar and style specifications.</p>

<h3>Referring to the STRIDES Initiative (e.g., program, team, partners, etc.)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For external materials, always include “Initiative” (with a capital ‘I’) after “STRIDES”(i.e., theSTRIDES Initiative)</li>
    <li>For internal materials, always include “Initiative” (with a capital ‘I’) after “STRIDES”in the first instance (i.e., the STRIDES Initiative), and then simply “STRIDES” for later instances.
    </li>
    <li>The STRIDES Initiative is a vehicle to access cloud service providersand their services and tools, not a cloud service provider itself. Think of it as a “store” to purchase cloudservices and tools through.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Referring to Groups Involved in the STRIDES Initiative</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>NIH STRIDES Initiative team</strong>
        – The CIT team managing the STRIDES Initiative.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>STRIDES Initiative partners</strong>
        – The commercial providers that NIH has established partnerships with (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud). In some cases, we will include the billing and administrative partners in this group.<ul>
            <li>Avoid mentioning specific STRIDES Initiative partners (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) unless it is necessary and specific information about the provider. This will ensure that there are fewer content updates needed in the future as NIH partners with additional cloud service providers.
            </li>
            <li>When listing the STRIDES Initiative partners, we always list them in alphabetical order to avoid perceived favoritism.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Commercial providers</strong>
        – More generally refers to industry leaders in the cloud-service space, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. This term is used generally, rather than the more specific and official “STRIDES Initiative partners” term (see above). Note: This term is avoided when “STRIDES Initiative partners” can be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Billing and administrative partners</strong>
        – The STRIDES Initiative partner’s third-party resellers (i.e., Four Points Technology for AWS and Carahsoft/Internet 2 NET+ for Google Cloud)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Referring to Users of the STRIDES Initiative</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Principal Investigator</strong>
        – This is the lead of the program/project who has scientific and/or technical responsibilities with at least one active NIH award. If you see a mention of “NIH-funded Principal Investigator,” omit “NIH-funded” from it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Program Officer</strong>
        – This person is the technical oversight of the program/project including aligning project/program goals with appropriate funding. If you see a mention of “Program Manager,” it should be changed to “Program Officer”.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Technical Lead</strong>
        – This person implements policies and technical infrastructure for the program/project. If you see a mention of “Technical POC” as a title, change it to “Technical Lead”.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Billing/Accounting Representative</strong>
        – This is the person within the institution or IC (not with a billing and administrative partner) with financial and purchasing responsibilities at the program/project level. If you see a mention of “Billing POC” as a title, change it to “Billing/Accounting Representative”.
        <ul>
            <li>Exception: “Billing POC” can only be used if referred to as a responsibility (e.g., “The Billing/Accounting Representative acts as the billing POC.”).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Style Guidance</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The STRIDES Initiative offers “services and tools”. If there is a mention of “services”, always make sure that “tools” is listed after it.
    </li>
    <li>The STRIDES Initiative offers “favorable pricing”, not a “discount”.
    </li>
    <li>When referring to researchers who work at extramural institutions and are eligible for STRIDES, refer to them as “NIH-funded researchers with an active NIH award”.
    </li>
    <li>If you see a mention of “projects” or “programs,” refer to it as “programs/projects” (e.g., a report that details total spend and use on programs/projects associated with each STRIDES Initiative account can be created).
        <ul>
            <li>Note that NIH-funded institutions work on “projects” whereas NIH ICOs work on “programs.” That is why when we speak generally about STRIDES Initiative for intramural and extramural, we say “programs/projects” to cover both.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>“Dataset” is spelled as one word.
    </li>
    <li>When mentioning the “cloud” in general, lowercase the “c” in “cloud”.
    </li>
    <li>If “NIH-funded” is mentioned, lowercase the “f” in “funded”.
    </li>
    <li>One “enrolls” in the STRIDES Initiative, rather than “sign ups”.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
