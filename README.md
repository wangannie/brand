# NIH STRIDES Visual Identity
This is the home of the NIH STRIDES Initiative's evolving brand assets and visual style guide. It's a work in progress, and we are releasing new assets as we are able.

## Contributing

### Installation
You should just be able to copy and paste each of the following steps to get the brand site up and running.

0. `git clone git@github.com:NIHGOV/STRIDES-Brand.git && cd brand`
0. `bundle install`
0. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
0. You should be able to see the branding site at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](127.0.0.1:4000)

### Making changes
Follow the installation instructions to get started but add the `--watch` option to the fourth step so you'd run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`. Jekyll is now instructed to watch for changes in your site and then rebuild when it notices them. This helps for local development because it means you can save a change and then refresh in your browser to see it.

When you've made some changes you'd like to contribute back, please open a pull request. You can find instructions for doing so in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
